# TOP_LandingPage# Landing Page Project

This project is a solution to the **Landing Page** assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). The goal is to recreate a landing page based on a given design, following best practices in HTML and CSS.


## How I Built It

- **Step-by-step Approach**: I followed a structured approach by starting with one section at a time, ensuring the HTML was solid before moving on to styling with CSS.
- **HTML First, CSS Later**: I focused on getting all the content onto the page in HTML first, then styled it using CSS. I referred to flexbox exercises to ensure proper layout and alignment.
- **Flexbox**: Many elements on this page utilize flexbox for layout, as learned in the flexbox exercises.


## Lessons Learned

- **Commit Early & Often**: I applied the principles from the Commit Message lesson, making regular, meaningful commits throughout the project.
- **Robust Styling**: Using flexbox helped manage layout challenges and ensured the design was aligned with the provided images.
